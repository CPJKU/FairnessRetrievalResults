# Welcome

The repository provides the code and resources for measuring/addressing societal biases in retrieval results. Please find more information about the contributions of the work in each of the following folders:

- `dataset`: the dataset of fairness sensitive queries.
- `measurement`: the code for measuring FaiRR and NFaiRR metrics on ranking results as well as ranker-agnostic document sets. 
- `adversarial_mitigation`: codes for adversarial training of BERT rankers (AdvBERT).

For any question please contact [Navid](mailto:navid.rekabsaz@jku.at).
