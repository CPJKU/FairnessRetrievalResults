# Welcome

The repository provides the code and resources for measuring and addressing societal biases in retrieval results, as discussed in the paper:

Societal Biases in Retrieved Contents: Measurement Framework and Adversarial Mitigation of BERT Rankers.\
*Navid Rekabsaz, Simone Kopeinik, Markus Schedl*. \
In proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2021).\
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13640)

Please find more information about each of the contributions in its corresponding folder:

- `dataset`: The dataset of fairness sensitive queries.
- `measurement`: The code for measuring FaiRR and NFaiRR metrics, calculated on ranking results or on ranker-agnostic document sets. 
- `adversarial_mitigation`: The code for adversarial training of BERT rankers to mitigate gender bias (AdvBERT).
